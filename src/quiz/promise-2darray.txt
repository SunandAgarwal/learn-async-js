Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

We need to handle the promises returned by the sum2DArray function and console log the corresponding result or error returned.
When we pass an array, the sum is returned after waiting for 0 seconds, while the second case throws an error because a string is passed.
